# Brigade Phase 61-100 Plan

This plan is the working queue for the next long roadmap completion run. It turns the remaining roadmap gaps, deferred items, and hardening needs into finite phases with testable stop conditions.

## Boundaries

- Keep behavior local, explicit, and receipt-backed.
- Do not add a daemon, scheduler mutation, hosted UI, database, remote sync, automatic promotion, automatic fixes, automatic memory mutation, automatic publish action, or secret storage.
- Do not copy private repo names, owner names, org names, private paths, raw chat, raw logs, raw scanner output, hostnames, tokens, webhook URLs, or exact external reference repo names into public docs, fixtures, imports, handoffs, or release evidence.
- Each phase must update focused tests, docs when public behavior changes, a Memory Handoff when durable knowledge is produced, and the roadmap status when complete.

## Phase Queue

### Phase 61: Roadmap Audit Precision And Phase Queue
Goal: make `brigade roadmap audit` accurate enough to drive phases 61-100. Normalize documented commands, stop treating prose and parameterized examples as missing CLI commands, close known pattern-owner gaps, and add this phase queue as the public source of truth.

Acceptance: roadmap audit tests cover command normalization, parent-command examples, prose filtering, stale phase behavior, and pattern coverage. README, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG, and this plan document the phase queue.

Status: implemented.

### Phase 62: Roadmap Ownership And Deferred Item Records
Goal: add explicit roadmap ownership records for deferred items so later phases can close or re-defer them without ambiguous status text.

Acceptance: roadmap audit JSON includes owner, subsystem, deferred reason, and suggested next phase for known deferred items.

Status: implemented with `deferred_items` in `brigade roadmap audit --json`.

### Phase 63: Public Command Documentation Contract
Goal: make public docs and CLI command discovery agree through a stable command contract, without relying on fragile prose scans.

Acceptance: tests compare documented command snippets to parser command paths and public docs list every supported top-level command group.

Status: implemented with `brigade roadmap commands`.

### Phase 64: Cross-Producer Provenance Compatibility Audit
Goal: audit scanner, backup, memory-care, security, review, tool-catalog, repo-fleet, and learning imports for a common provenance and fingerprint contract.

Acceptance: focused fixtures prove every local producer writes source fingerprints, safe summaries, evidence labels, and dismissed-until-changed metadata.

Status: implemented with `brigade work import provenance` and inbox doctor provenance contract warnings.

### Phase 65: Producer Privacy Regression Suite
Goal: add shared privacy fixtures proving raw private evidence never leaks from producer outputs into imports, handoffs, context packs, release evidence, or public docs.
