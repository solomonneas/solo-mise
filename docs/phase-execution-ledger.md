# Phase Execution Ledger

Brigade uses the phase execution ledger to make long unattended work auditable. A multi-phase goal is not complete because an operator says it is complete. It is complete only when the ledger contains a record for each phase, with evidence or an explicit deferral.

The ledger is local and gitignored:

```text
.brigade/work/phases/
```

Public docs describe the contract. Local records hold the run-specific evidence.

## Commands

```bash
brigade work phases init
brigade work phases plan --phase-id phase-165 --title "Auditable AFK ledger" --goal "phase 165"
brigade work phases plan --range 165-170 --grouped --title "Grouped hardening" --goal "phase range"
brigade work phases list
brigade work phases show <phase-id>
brigade work phases start <phase-id>
brigade work phases complete <phase-id> --summary "..." --file src/file.py --test "pytest ..." --commit <hash> --push-ref main
brigade work phases defer <phase-id> --reason "..."
brigade work phases doctor --range 165-170
```

Every command supports stable JSON output with `--json`.

## Record Contract

Each phase record includes:

- `phase_id`
- `title`
- `source_goal`
- `status`
- `started_at`
- `completed_at`
- `implementation_summary`
- `files_changed`
- `tests_run`
- `test_result_summary`
- `commit_hash`
- `push_ref`
- `deferred_items`
- `blocker_reason`
- `next_phase_recommendation`

Allowed statuses:

- `pending`
- `in-progress`
- `implemented`
- `verified`
- `committed`
- `pushed`
- `deferred`
- `blocked`

## No Silent Compression

Grouped work is allowed, but it must be declared before work starts.

If a goal covers phases 200 through 210, the operator must either:

- create one record for each phase, or
- create an explicit grouped range with `brigade work phases plan --range 200-210 --grouped`.

Completing a range requires every phase in that range to be implemented or explicitly deferred. A broad summary record that claims a range without an explicit grouping record is a ledger issue.

## Completion Rule

A phase is not complete unless the ledger has evidence:

- changed files, or a deferral reason
- tests run, or a clear deferred verification reason
- commit hash when marked `committed`
- push ref when marked `pushed`

Deferral is acceptable. Silent compression is not.

## Doctor Checks

`brigade work phases doctor` reports:

- complete phases without tests
- complete phases without changed files or deferral evidence
- committed phases without commit hashes
- pushed phases without push refs
- missing records for a requested range
- range records compressed without explicit grouping
- stale in-progress phases
- blocked phases without a next recommendation

The phase ledger is surfaced in `brigade daily status`, `brigade daily doctor`, `brigade work brief`, `brigade work doctor`, and `brigade center status`.
