# Release Readiness

`brigade release` is a local publish gate. It collects the receipts and health checks Brigade already knows how to read, then writes a reviewable release-readiness receipt without pushing, tagging, creating a release, or mutating remotes.

## Commands

```bash
brigade release plan
brigade release doctor
brigade release run
brigade release runs
brigade release show <run-id>
brigade release candidate plan
brigade release candidate build
brigade release candidate list
brigade release candidate show <candidate-id>
brigade release candidate archive <candidate-id>
```

`plan` gathers local evidence and reports readiness without running publish checks or writing a receipt.

`doctor` runs local publish checks such as content-guard when available, then reports blockers and warnings without writing a receipt.

`run` performs the same readiness checks as `doctor` and writes a receipt under:

```text
.brigade/release/runs/
```

`runs` and `show` inspect those receipts.

`release candidate` commands turn readiness receipts into local candidate bundles under `.brigade/release/candidates/`. They do not push, tag, create releases, or mutate remotes. See [`release-candidates.md`](release-candidates.md).

## Evidence

Release readiness includes:

- latest work closeout
- latest work verification receipt
- latest code review closeout
- latest scanner sweep review state
- latest security health and evidence state
- handoff draft and ingest health
- git branch, dirty tracked files, upstream, ahead count, and behind count
- README, CHANGELOG, and ROADMAP touch warnings when user-facing code changed
- content-guard tip scan when available
- introduced-content scan when a base ref is provided and content-guard is available

## Blockers And Warnings

Blockers include missing or blocked work closeout, missing or failed verification, unclosed review runs, unresolved code-review findings, unresolved scanner sweep issues, open security issues, stale or invalid handoff draft state, content-guard failures, and dirty tracked files.

Warnings include missing content-guard, docs/changelog/roadmap touch expectations, stale release candidate bundles, missing candidate receipt references, changed git HEAD since candidate build, and candidates built from blocked readiness. Warnings do not make the receipt blocked by themselves.

## Boundary

Release readiness is local and explicit. Brigade does not run `git push`, create tags, create GitHub releases, write pull request comments, mutate GitHub, approve content-guard findings, store secrets, start daemons, or install schedulers.
