# Repo Fleet

`brigade repos` inspects configured local repositories from gitignored `.brigade/repos.toml`. It is a local operator workflow for safe labels, readiness checks, report bundles, and reviewed fleet actions.

Fleet reports include safe repo ids, safe labels, status counts, blocker and warning counts, top pending action summaries, receipt labels, and suggested next commands. Fleet actions store local metadata only: repo id, safe label, source subsystem, source local id, status, priority or severity, safe summary, suggested command, timestamps, and source fingerprint.

`brigade repos sweep plan` shows which configured repos would be refreshed and which read-only local Brigade commands would run. `brigade repos sweep run` executes the configured foreground refresh for selected repos, records per-repo command summaries, and stores raw stdout and stderr only in gitignored local logs. Receipt JSON uses repo ids, safe labels, command labels, status counts, fingerprints, and local log labels. It does not store exact repo paths.

Repos may define optional read-only health commands in gitignored config:

```toml
[[repo.health_command]]
label = "local-health"
command = "python3 -m brigade work brief --json"
timeout = 120
```

Health commands are parsed into argv and run without a shell. High-risk shell, remote-copy, and metacharacter-heavy command shapes are rejected before a sweep runs.

Sweep filters include `--repo <repo-id>`, `--all`, `--stale-only`, `--include-disabled`, and `--force`. `brigade repos sweep closeout` marks a sweep as `reviewed`, `deferred`, `superseded`, or `archived` after the operator has inspected the refreshed evidence. Fleet reports, center status, center reviews, work brief, work doctor, and release doctor surface stale, failed, or unclosed fleet sweeps.

`brigade repos actions build` requires the source fleet report to be closed out as `reviewed` or `deferred` unless `--allow-unreviewed` is passed. Repeated builds dedupe by repo id, report fingerprint, and source item fingerprint, including archived actions from the same report.

`brigade repos actions dispatch` bridges fleet-level review into the target repo's local work loop. `dispatch plan` previews the task import that would be written. `dispatch apply` writes a `source: repo-fleet` task import into the target repo's existing `.brigade/work/imports/inbox.jsonl`, with acceptance criteria and fleet provenance. `dispatch --all-reviewed` applies the same path to reviewed pending or active actions. `--dry-run` writes nothing.

Dispatch is idempotent by fleet action id and source fingerprint. Repeated dispatch of the same action skips equivalent pending or promoted imports. Dismissed target imports stay dismissed until the source fingerprint changes. When the fingerprint changes, Brigade creates a new target import and marks prior dispatch imports superseded.

`brigade repos actions context plan/build` creates an action-scoped context pack in the target repo under `.brigade/context/packs/`. These packs include safe action summary, acceptance criteria, guidance presence, local receipt labels, and explicit private-evidence exclusions. They do not copy raw guidance contents, raw logs, raw scanner output, private paths, exact private repo names, owner names, org names, hostnames, or secrets.

`brigade repos actions reconcile` reads target repo work imports, promoted tasks, completed tasks, closeouts, release readiness receipts, and operator reports, then updates local fleet action metadata. Reconciliation states include `dispatched`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `dismissed`, `superseded`, `stale`, and `broken-reference`. Completed target tasks mark the fleet action done. Repo fleet health also warns when safe target evidence changes after dispatch. No suggested command is executed.

`brigade repos release plan/build/list/show/compare/closeout/archive` coordinates release readiness across configured repos without publishing anything. A release train collects safe per-repo evidence from fleet sweeps, fleet reports, fleet action reconciliation, target repo operator reports, work closeouts, verification receipts, review closeouts, security closeouts, release readiness receipts, release candidates, dirty tracked counts, and ahead or behind labels when available.

Each repo is classified as `ready`, `blocked`, `needs-review`, `needs-dispatch`, `in-progress`, `stale-evidence`, `no-release-candidate`, or `deferred`. `build` writes `FLEET_RELEASE_TRAIN.md`, `FLEET_RELEASE_EVIDENCE.json`, and `MANUAL_PUBLISH_PLAN.md`. The publish plan contains placeholders and manual-only checklist steps for verification, release doctor, candidate compare, tags, pushes, and release creation. Brigade does not execute any publish step.

`brigade repos release compare <train-id|latest>` checks whether captured repo HEAD labels changed, newer release readiness or candidate receipts exist, fleet action reconciliation changed, referenced safe receipt ids disappeared, or unresolved fleet action state changed. `closeout` records `reviewed`, `deferred`, `superseded`, or `archived` status. Repo doctor, center status, center reviews, work brief, work doctor, and release doctor surface blocked, stale, or unclosed release train state.

Privacy boundaries:

- No cloning.
- No remote mutation.
- No push, tag, release, PR, visibility, transfer, or archive mutation.
- No automatic action execution.
- No automatic promotion or dismissal.
- No automatic target task promotion, work run, or code fix.
- No exact private repo names, owner names, org names, hostnames, local paths, raw logs, scanner output, private config contents, secrets, or raw evidence in public files.
- Gitignored local config may store local paths and safe labels.
