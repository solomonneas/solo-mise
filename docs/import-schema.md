# Brigade Work Import JSONL Schema

Brigade work imports are the local handoff contract for scanners, wrappers, and chat adapters that discover candidate work. Producers write JSON Lines files, then an operator or wrapper validates and ingests them with `brigade work import`.

Imports are local review items. They do not write canonical memory directly.

## Commands

```bash
brigade work import validate imports.jsonl
brigade work import ingest imports.jsonl
brigade work import memory-care
brigade work import memory-refresh
brigade work import chat-sweep
brigade work inbox
brigade work import triage
brigade work import plan <import-id>
brigade work import promote --run <import-id>
brigade work import promote --all --source memory-care --kind task
```

`validate` checks a JSONL file without writing. `ingest` appends valid records into `.brigade/work/imports/inbox.jsonl`, skipping duplicate pending records with the same source, kind, and normalized text. Scanner producers can also provide stable source item keys and fingerprints so repeated ingestion skips equivalent pending or promoted imports, while dismissed imports stay dismissed unless the source item changes materially. `inbox` groups pending imports for daily review. `plan` previews the task a reviewed import would create. `promote --run` promotes one task import and immediately runs it through the normal work-session loop. `memory-care` reads `memory/cards/decay/refresh-queue.json` and converts queued cards into task imports. `memory-refresh` accepts the same queue plus `candidates` or `refresh_candidates` and writes TDD-ready refresh task imports. `chat-sweep` reads `.brigade/chat-memory-sweeps/latest.json` and converts sweep `issues`; actionable issues become task imports.

## Record Shape

Each non-empty line must be one JSON object:

```json
{"text":"Refresh memory card memory/cards/tools.md: source-of-truth changed","kind":"task","source":"memory-care","metadata":{"card_file":"memory/cards/tools.md","reason":"source-of-truth changed"}}
```

Required fields:

- `text`: non-empty string. The operator-facing candidate work.

Optional fields:

- `kind`: one of `task`, `finding`, `decision`, `preference`, `incident`, `link`, or `command`. Defaults to `task`.
- `source`: non-empty string identifying the producer, such as `memory-care`, `slack`, `discord`, `telegram`, or `repo-scan`. Defaults to `manual`.
- `metadata`: JSON object with producer-specific context.

Task-only optional fields:

- `type`: one of `task`, `feature`, `bug`, `docs`, `security`, `workflow`, `research`, or `chore`.
- `priority`: one of `low`, `normal`, `high`, or `urgent`.
- `template`: one of `vertical-slice`, `bugfix`, `red-green-refactor`, `docs`, or `security-follow-up`.
- `acceptance`: list of non-empty strings. These become local task acceptance criteria when the import is promoted.

Task fields are valid only when `kind` is `task`. When a task import is promoted, Brigade preserves these fields on the local task ledger item and keeps source-specific details in `metadata`.

Recommended metadata keys:

- `card_file`: memory card path for memory-care records.
- `card_id`: stable memory card identity.
- `reason`: short reason the item was produced.
- `refresh_reason`: reason a memory card needs review.
- `source_item_key`: stable producer item key used for idempotency.
- `source_fingerprint`: producer item fingerprint used to detect material changes.
- `sweep_path`: local chat memory sweep JSON path.
- `sweep_id`: stable chat sweep id.
- `sweep_issue_id`: stable issue id inside a chat sweep.
- `issue_title`: title from a chat memory sweep issue.
- `issue_source`: original issue source such as cron, delivery, crawler, or bridge.
- `provider`: scanner provider or memory owner that produced the item.
- `workspace`: chat workspace or source workspace.
- `channel`: chat channel or surface name.
- `thread`: thread id, message range, or export locator.
- `message_range`: local message range or export range.
- `confidence`: producer confidence such as `low`, `medium`, or `high`.
- `evidence_summary`: compact evidence summary, not raw private chat text.
- `evidence`: local evidence path, not raw private chat text.

## Privacy Rules

- Keep raw chat exports, message bodies, and third-party personal details out of public docs and public repos.
- Store source locators and summaries in metadata instead of raw message quotes.
- Route durable memory changes through reviewed Memory Handoffs. Do not let scanners edit memory cards directly by default.

## Memory-Care And Memory-Refresh Producers

The memory-care and memory-refresh producers read this refresh queue by default:

```text
memory/cards/decay/refresh-queue.json
```

Minimal queue shape:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "file": "memory/cards/example.md",
      "reason": "source-of-truth changed"
    }
  ]
}
```

Run:

```bash
brigade work import memory-care
brigade work import memory-refresh
brigade work import triage
```

`memory-care` keeps the legacy source name `memory-care`. `brigade memory care scan` now produces this queue directly from local memory cards, and `brigade memory care import-issues` imports it into the work inbox. `memory-refresh` uses source `memory-refresh` and also accepts `candidates` or `refresh_candidates`.

Memory-refresh candidates can include `id` or `card_id`, `file`, `refresh_reason`, `issue_type`, `safe_summary`, `confidence`, `evidence_references`, `evidence_summary`, `suggested_refresh_action`, `source_item_key`, `source_fingerprint`, `priority`, `template`, and `acceptance`. The producer writes `task` imports preserving card identity, refresh reason, queue path, safe summary, evidence summary, source item key, and source fingerprint metadata.

Memory-care issue types are `stale`, `expired`, `undersourced`, `contradictory`, `missing-index-link`, `orphaned-card`, `oversized-card`, and `missing-frontmatter`. Memory-care imports are review items only. Brigade does not edit memory cards automatically.

## Chat Memory Sweep Producer

The chat-sweep producer reads this summary by default:

```text
.brigade/chat-memory-sweeps/latest.json
```

Minimal sweep shape:

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-05-26T22:09:00-04:00",
  "sessions": {
    "listed": 24,
    "reviewed": 10,
    "durable": 1
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "sweep-issue-1",
      "title": "Cron delivery failure",
      "summary": "Recent message delivery failed.",
      "kind": "incident",
      "source": "cron",
      "severity": "warning",
      "metadata": {
        "surface": "discord",
        "local_locator": "crawler://discord/example"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Run:

```bash
brigade work import chat-sweep
brigade work import triage
```

The producer writes imports with source `chat-memory-sweep`, preserving local locators and summary metadata. If an issue has `actionable: true`, `task: true`, or `kind: "task"`, Brigade writes a `task` import with task metadata and acceptance criteria. The JSON output reports `created`, `skipped`, `dismissed`, and `invalid` counts for wrappers.

The producer omits raw private fields such as `raw_text`, `raw_messages`, `messages`, `message_text`, `quotes`, and `transcript`. Use `summary`, `evidence_summary`, and local evidence locators instead of copying private chat bodies into the inbox.
