  <code>brigade</code> is the operator-system CLI for agent workspaces.
  It gives you the workspace skeleton, handoff inbox, conservative ingester,
  and publish guards that make a multi-agent setup usable.
</p>

## What this is

Mise en place means "everything in its place before the work starts."
In a kitchen, that is chopped mirepoix, clean pans, labels, and a station that does not make you hunt for salt mid-service.
For agents, it is the same idea: rules, memory, tools, handoff inboxes, publish guards, and boring verification already laid out before the session gets expensive.

This package lays down a clean starting point for an agent workspace or a repo that needs durable memory handoffs.
It is meant for people running real tools, real docs, and real automation across OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, or a similar harness.

The cookbook explains the why. This package gives you the kitchen.

## What you get

- sanitized bootstrap files for agent behavior, safety, tools, identity, and memory
- a canonical memory layout where one configured owner holds durable knowledge
- writer-specific Memory Handoff inboxes, such as `.claude/memory-handoffs/` for Claude Code and `.codex/memory-handoffs/` for Codex
- starter memory cards and routing rules
- multi-workspace handoff patterns for people administering more than one agent setup
- memory-care staleness checks so durable cards do not quietly rot
- TokenJuice output-compaction guidance for Claude Code and Codex, including wrapper notes and savings expectations
- content-guard publish gates so private infrastructure does not leak into public docs
- built-in agent workspace security scan for secrets, permissions, hooks, MCP configs, supply-chain patterns, and instruction risks
- adapter fragments for OpenClaw (tested), Hermes (stubbed), and generic harnesses
- doctor checks that prove the system is wired before you trust it

Browse the public template index in [`templates/`](templates/).
The installable source files live under `src/brigade/templates/`; root workspace files are local dogfood state and stay ignored.

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the daily-driver, scanner inbox, chat-surface scanner, and memory-card decay roadmap.

## What you do not get

- private hostnames, IPs, account IDs, or personal details
- live auth profiles or OAuth tokens
- cron jobs that post publicly by default
- destructive automation or write-enabled integrations without explicit opt-in

## Install

```bash
pipx install brigade-cli
```

Or, to track `main`:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/escoffier-labs/brigade
```

The workspace config directory is `.brigade` (older `.solo-mise` installs are still read), and the `solo-mise` command is a deprecated alias for `brigade`.

## Quick path

Run `brigade init` with no flags for the interactive picker:

```bash
brigade init --target ~/agent-kitchen
```

For CI or scripts, pass flags directly:

```bash
brigade init --target ~/agent-kitchen --depth workspace --harnesses claude,codex,openclaw
brigade init --target ./repo --depth repo --harnesses codex
brigade init --target ./repo --harnesses none           # generic install
```

Once installed, `brigade doctor` verifies the wiring and `brigade status` reports over the station registry.
For machines that ingest handoffs from multiple repos, copy `.brigade/handoff-sources.example.json` to `.brigade/handoff-sources.json` and list the repo roots and writer inboxes the canonical ingestor scans.
`brigade handoff doctor` reports pending `.claude/memory-handoffs/` and `.codex/memory-handoffs/` files that are not covered by that local source list.
Run `brigade handoff lint` before ingesting pending handoffs when you want to catch action/target mismatches early.
If your ingestor writes a latest-run log, set `ingestor.last_run_log` in that local config so the doctor can warn on stale runs, skipped malformed handoffs, and warning summaries hidden behind no-reply cron output.
Use `brigade handoff issues` to group those warnings with repair guidance, then `brigade handoff sync-issues` to import new issues and close stale local handoff tasks/imports once the latest scan no longer reports them.

## Run a brigade

`brigade run "<task>"` is the aboyeur path.
One orchestrator plans the work, Brigade dispatches assigned workers through their own CLIs, then the orchestrator synthesizes the final answer.
It is intentionally bounded: two orchestrator calls plus the worker calls in the plan.

Start with a roster:

```bash
brigade roster init
brigade roster doctor
```

That writes `.brigade/roster.toml` with a Codex orchestrator, a Codex coder, and an optional Ollama local researcher:

```toml
orchestrator = "chef"

[agents.chef]
cli = "codex"
role = "Plan the work, choose useful workers, and synthesize the final answer."

[agents.local_researcher]
cli = "ollama:llama3.3"
role = "Research locally and summarize useful findings."
timeout_seconds = 300

[agents.coder]
cli = "codex"
role = "Make precise code changes and report what changed."

[limits]
max_workers = 4
timeout_seconds = 600
allow_models = ["codex", "ollama:*"]
```

Edit the roles, CLI refs, and timeouts to match the tools on your machine.
`limits.timeout_seconds` is the default per-agent timeout.
`agents.<name>.timeout_seconds` overrides it for one agent.
Then run:

```bash
brigade run "review this repo and suggest the next implementation step"
brigade run "plan the migration" --dry-run
brigade run "review this repo" --show-plan
brigade run "review this repo" --verbose
brigade run "review this repo" --cwd /path/to/repo

Common `brigade run` flags:

- `--dry-run` prints planned assignments as JSON and stops before worker dispatch.
- `--show-plan` prints assignments before a normal run.
- `--verbose` prints the plan, worker statuses, and synthesis status.
- `--cwd` sets the working directory for agent CLI calls.
- `--handoff` writes a Memory Handoff for a successful non-dry run.
- `--inspect` prints the same artifact summary as `brigade runs show`.
- `--read-only` tells the orchestrator and workers to inspect and recommend only.

For `codex` agents, `--read-only` also passes `codex exec --sandbox read-only`.
Other adapters receive the prompt policy only.

The `cli` values are adapters for installed command-line tools:
`codex`, `claude`, and `ollama:<model>`. Brigade shells out to those tools and keeps no provider keys.
Run `brigade roster doctor` to validate roster syntax and check which CLIs are on `PATH`.

### Dogfood

`brigade dogfood` is the shortcut for using Brigade on itself or another trusted repo.
It uses a built-in Codex-only roster, read-only prompt policy, normal run artifacts, a default Memory Handoff, and an artifact summary.

Set it up once:

```bash
brigade dogfood init --target /path/to/repo
```

That writes local defaults to `.brigade/dogfood.toml`, which is gitignored because it stores machine-local paths and preferences.
New dogfood configs default handoffs to `.codex/memory-handoffs/` because the dogfood roster is Codex-driven.
Pass `--handoff-inbox` if your memory owner ingests a different path.

Daily commands:

- `brigade dogfood` runs the configured daily path from the repo.
- `brigade dogfood "review today's changes"` overrides only the task.
- `brigade dogfood status` checks paths, sandbox mode, CLI availability, ignore rules, and the latest run.
- `brigade dogfood latest` shows the latest configured dogfood run.
- `brigade dogfood next` prints the latest extracted next step.

Dogfood writes `summary.md` beside each run's JSON artifacts when a final answer or next step exists.
It defaults to a 600 second per-agent timeout.
Trusted-workspace runs use Codex's `danger-full-access` sandbox setting by default so repo inspection works on hosts where native read-only sandboxing blocks shell inspection.

Useful switches:

- `--no-handoff` skips the dogfood handoff.
- `--no-inspect` skips the artifact summary.
- `--native-read-only-sandbox` uses Codex's native read-only sandbox when the host supports it.

CLI runs write artifacts by default under `.brigade/runs/<id>` below `--cwd`; dogfood runs use `.brigade/runs/<id>` below the configured target:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `run.json` | task, cwd, orchestrator, mode flags, status, artifact path, handoff path, timestamps, and duration |
| `roster.json` | effective orchestrator, agents, limits, allow-list, and timeouts |
| `plan-attempts.json` | raw planner outputs, parse status, and parse errors from initial/correction attempts |
| `plan.json` | parsed worker assignments |
| `worker-results.json` | worker status, details, and text output for non-dry runs |
| `synthesis.json` | orchestrator synthesis status, detail, and raw text for non-dry runs |
| `final.txt` | final synthesized answer for non-dry runs |
| `summary.md` | dogfood summary with run metadata, final answer, and extracted next step when present |

Use `--output-dir <path>` to pick the artifact directory, or `--no-artifacts` for a throwaway run.

### Daily Work Loop

Use `brigade work bootstrap` once per repo.
It writes or verifies `.brigade/dogfood.toml`, creates local artifact directories, creates the handoff inbox, updates `.gitignore`, and reports readiness.

Start-of-day commands:

- `brigade work brief` shows branch state, active sessions, pending tasks, import counts, latest dogfood run, and the command to continue.
- `brigade work status` is the quick dashboard for branch state, dogfood readiness, paths, latest run, and extracted next step.
- `brigade work doctor` checks dogfood config, security config, evidence bundles, Codex CLI, artifact paths, handoff inbox, task acceptance, issue-backed tasks, stale active sessions, ignore coverage, and latest run context.
- `brigade work resume` shows the active or latest session, latest dogfood run, extracted next step, and suggested command.
- `brigade work inbox` groups pending scanner imports by source, kind, priority, age, and acceptance coverage, then suggests plan, promote, dismiss, or run commands.
- `brigade work backup status` reads local backup health summaries and reports snapshot, check, prune, and restore rehearsal risk without running backup commands.
- `brigade work scanners plan` inspects the local scanner registry and suggests staggered run windows.
- `brigade work scanners run --due` explicitly runs due enabled scanner producers, writes local receipts, and leaves promotion to the operator.
- `brigade work sweep` explicitly runs due scanner producers, ingests configured JSONL outputs by default, and writes one local sweep report for review.
- `brigade work sweep-review latest` shows created imports, skipped or dismissed fingerprints, grouping, and next commands for the latest sweep.
- `brigade work sweep closeout latest` records that all actionable sweep imports were promoted, dismissed, archived, or explicitly deferred.
- `brigade roadmap audit` reports roadmap status, stale phase sections, documented command drift, and optional roadmap-audit work imports.
- `brigade roadmap patterns` shows neutral inspiration pattern coverage and source-pattern decisions without naming private references.
- `brigade repos scan` inspects configured local repos for safe setup metadata, and `brigade repos import-issues` routes repo-fleet gaps into the work inbox.
- `brigade chat sweep import-issues <surface-id>` converts a local chat export sweep into public-safe scanner inbox imports.
- `brigade tools doctor` inspects the local portable tool catalog and reports source, projection, schema, MCP, auth-field, and command-shape issues without invoking tools.
- `brigade work next` prints only the next task. Add `--json` for wrappers.

Task ledger commands:

- `brigade work tasks` lists `.brigade/work/tasks.json`.
- `brigade work task add "..."` queues a task manually.
- `brigade work task add "..." --type feature --priority high --acceptance "..."` queues typed work with repeatable acceptance criteria.
- `brigade work task add "..." --template bugfix --acceptance "Regression test passes"` adds template acceptance criteria while preserving explicit acceptance criteria.
- `brigade work task add --from-issue 42` imports a GitHub issue with `gh issue view` when `gh` is available, including acceptance criteria parsed from issue-body checkboxes or acceptance/test sections.
- `brigade work task add --from-next` promotes the latest extracted dogfood next step.
- `brigade work task plan <task-id>` shows the task metadata, acceptance checklist, template guidance, and suggested run command.
- `brigade work task done <task-id>` closes queued work.

Available task templates are `vertical-slice`, `bugfix`, `red-green-refactor`, `docs`, and `security-follow-up`.
Issue-backed tasks keep issue URL, number, title, labels, state, and source metadata in the local gitignored ledger.
Issue body text is not stored, and Brigade does not poll, sync, mutate, or refresh GitHub issues in the background.

Import inbox commands:

- `brigade work import add "..."` creates a scanner-ready local import.
- `brigade work import validate imports.jsonl` checks scanner output against [`docs/import-schema.md`](docs/import-schema.md).
- `brigade work import ingest imports.jsonl` ingests scanner output.
- `brigade memory care scan` scans local memory cards for stale, expired, undersourced, contradictory, missing-index-link, orphaned, oversized, and missing-frontmatter issues without editing memory.
- `brigade memory care import-issues` routes the latest memory-care refresh queue into the work inbox.
- `brigade work import memory-care` converts `memory/cards/decay/refresh-queue.json` into imports.
- `brigade work import memory-refresh` converts memory-refresh candidates into task imports with card identity, reason, evidence summary, and acceptance criteria.
- `brigade work import chat-sweep` converts `.brigade/chat-memory-sweeps/latest.json` issues into imports. Actionable sweep issues become task imports with acceptance criteria, while raw private chat text is omitted.
- `brigade work import triage` groups pending imports by source and kind; use `--source`, `--kind`, and repeatable `--metadata key=value` to narrow noisy queues.
- `brigade work import show <import-id>` inspects one import.
- `brigade work import plan <import-id>` previews the exact task or handoff promotion would create, including acceptance criteria, template guidance, or handoff target.
- `brigade work import plan-handoff <import-id>` previews the Memory Handoff draft target for durable non-task imports.
- `brigade work import dismiss <import-id>` removes one noisy item, while `dismiss --all` closes filtered batches.
- `brigade work import promote <import-id>` promotes one reviewed import into the task ledger.
- `brigade work import promote-handoff <import-id>` promotes one reviewed durable import into a linted Memory Handoff draft.
- `brigade work import promote --run <import-id>` promotes exactly one task import, then immediately runs that task through the normal work-session loop.
- `brigade work import promote --all --source memory-care --kind task` batch-promotes filtered imports; metadata filters also work for scanner-specific fields such as `handoff_issue_category=route-skip`.
- `brigade work inbox doctor` reports missing scanner provenance, stale pending imports, broken promoted task links, changed dismissed fingerprints, noisy sources, scanner runs that produced no imports, missing sweep references, and unclosed sweeps.
- `brigade work inbox archive` moves old promoted, dismissed, and superseded imports into `.brigade/work/imports/archive.jsonl` while preserving pending imports.

Imports are stored under `.brigade/work/imports/inbox.jsonl`, stay gitignored, and do not write memory directly.
Scanner-authored task imports may include `type`, `priority`, `template`, and `acceptance`; promotion preserves those fields so imported tasks can enter the normal TDD work loop.
Durable non-task imports such as decisions, preferences, links, commands, findings, and incidents can be promoted only into reviewed Memory Handoff drafts. Brigade writes the draft to the configured local handoff inbox, lints it, stores the handoff path and target document on the promoted import, and does not edit `MEMORY.md`, memory cards, or canonical memory.
Scanner producer imports use source item keys and fingerprints when available. Repeated ingestion skips equivalent pending or promoted imports, and dismissed imports stay dismissed unless the source item changes materially. Imports created during scanner runs carry provenance metadata when Brigade can attach it, including scanner id, source, run id, receipt path, output snapshot, import path, and source fingerprint.
`brigade work doctor` warns when scanner queues go stale, task imports lack acceptance criteria, or a source produces many dismissed imports.
For handoff-ingest issues, prefer `brigade handoff sync-issues` over repeated raw imports. It imports only issue ids that have not already been seen locally and marks stale handoff-ingest imports/tasks resolved when the latest log no longer contains them.

Handoff draft queue commands:

- `brigade handoff list` lists local Memory Handoff drafts from `.claude/memory-handoffs/`, `.codex/memory-handoffs/`, and configured source inboxes.
- `brigade handoff show <handoff-id-or-path>` shows lint status, target card or document, source import id, source fingerprint, scanner provenance, and stale age.
- `brigade handoff archive <handoff-id-or-path>` moves one reviewed draft into `.brigade/handoffs/archive/` and records closeout metadata in `.brigade/handoffs/archive.jsonl`.
- `brigade handoff archive --all-reviewed` archives lint-valid drafts only. It does not run the canonical ingestor or edit memory.
- `brigade handoff runs` and `brigade handoff run-show <run-id>` read normalized local ingestion receipts from `.brigade/handoffs/ingest-runs/`.
- `brigade handoff reconcile` parses the configured `ingestor.last_run_log`, writes a normalized local receipt, and connects ingested, skipped, or failed outcomes back to draft and archive metadata. It does not run the ingestor or edit canonical memory.

Scanner registry commands:

- `brigade work scanners init` writes gitignored `.brigade/scanners.toml` with local producer entries for chat sweep, memory refresh, handoff ingest sync, security findings, backup health, and tool catalog health.
- `brigade work scanners list` and `show <scanner-id>` inspect configured scanner commands, sources, cadence, timeout, output paths, and conflict windows.
- `brigade work scanners plan` calculates intended run windows, reports overlaps or clustered jobs, and prints a suggested staggered schedule.
- `brigade work scanners run <scanner-id>`, `run --all`, and `run --due` execute configured enabled scanner entries explicitly, never through a shell, and refuse disabled, risky, or overlapping runs unless the matching review flag is present.
- `brigade work scanners run <scanner-id> --ingest-output` validates and ingests the scanner's configured JSONL `import_path` after a successful run. Without the flag, Brigade records the receipt and leaves output ingestion explicit.
- `brigade work scanners runs` and `run-show <run-id>` inspect receipts under `.brigade/scanners/runs/`, including exit code, timeout state, stdout/stderr summaries, log paths, output snapshots, and pending import counts after the run.
- `brigade work sweep` is the daily operator action for scanner review. It runs due scanners by default, or `--all` / `--scanner <id>` when selected, ingests configured JSONL outputs unless `--no-ingest` is present, and writes one report under `.brigade/scanners/sweeps/`.
- `brigade work sweeps` and `brigade work sweep-show <sweep-id>` review sweep reports, including scanner run receipt paths, import counts, inbox hygiene, and suggested next commands.
- `brigade work sweep-review <sweep-id>` and `sweep-review latest` triage one sweep by grouping created imports by source, kind, priority, acceptance coverage, provenance completeness, and status. Pending imports show exact plan, promote, dismiss, promote-run, plan-handoff, or promote-handoff commands as appropriate.
- `brigade work sweep closeout <sweep-id|latest>` marks a sweep reviewed only after all actionable imports are no longer pending, or after the operator records explicit deferrals with `--defer <import-id>` or `--defer-all`.
- `brigade work scanners doctor --import-issues` reports missing config, disabled required producers, bad commands, missing or stale output paths, schedule conflicts, failed or timed-out runs, malformed receipts, missing logs, and due scanners, then can import those health issues as local task imports.

The scanner registry is explicit and local. Brigade does not install cron jobs, start a daemon, run scanners from `brief` or `doctor`, promote scanner output automatically, or mutate scanner output beyond the configured command's own behavior. `brigade work sweep` is still explicit foreground execution, not a scheduler, `sweep-review` is read-only, and sweep closeout records review state only.

Roadmap and repo-fleet commands:

- `brigade roadmap audit` parses `ROADMAP.md`, classifies roadmap bullets, detects stale current or next phase sections, compares documented commands with the CLI, and can import roadmap hygiene issues with `--import-issues`.
- `brigade roadmap patterns` shows neutral pattern-family coverage and local source-pattern decisions: `bake-in`, `integrate`, `catalog-only`, `move-candidate`, and `leave-alone`.
- `brigade repos init` writes gitignored `.brigade/repos.toml`.
- `brigade repos list`, `show <repo-id>`, and `scan` report safe repo metadata only: repo labels, branch, dirty counts, guidance-file presence, docs presence, test hints, handoff inboxes, publish-guard hook presence, Brigade config presence, and local receipt references.
- `brigade repos doctor` reports setup gaps, and `brigade repos import-issues` creates `source: repo-fleet` task imports with stable source fingerprints.
- `brigade repos report plan/build/list/show/archive/closeout` builds local fleet operator reports under `.brigade/repos/reports/`, using safe repo ids, labels, counts, statuses, and receipt labels only.
- `brigade repos actions plan/build/list/show/start/done/defer/archive` turns reviewed fleet reports into local fleet action queues under `.brigade/repos/actions/` without executing the suggested commands.

Repo fleet and pattern registry output is local and privacy preserving. It records presence, counts, labels, fingerprints, and receipt references, but does not copy repo guidance files, private paths, raw logs, scanner output, private config, owner names, exact private repo names, or raw evidence into public artifacts.

Code review producer commands:

- `brigade work review init` writes gitignored `.brigade/reviews.toml` with disabled starter entries for Codex review, Claude Opus review, and custom local reviewers.
- `brigade work review plan` shows configured reviewer commands, cwd, timeout, target paths, base ref, output path, findings path, and command blockers without executing anything.
- `brigade work review run <reviewer-id>` and `run --all` execute configured reviewers explicitly, never through a shell, and write receipts under `.brigade/reviews/runs/`.
- `brigade work review runs` and `brigade work review show <run-id>` inspect review receipts, including exit code, timeout state, stdout/stderr summaries, log paths, findings path, and reviewed completed task ids when available.
- `brigade work review import-findings <run-id>` reads the run's normalized findings JSON, redacts unsafe values, and routes findings into the existing work inbox with source `code-review`.
- `brigade work review findings` and `finding-show <finding-id-or-import-id>` inspect imported review findings by reviewer, run, severity, category, path, inbox status, and resolution state.
- `brigade work review closeout <run-id>` or `closeout latest` writes a local closeout record that connects review findings to pending imports, dismissals, promoted tasks, completed tasks, and source-fingerprint changes requiring re-review.

Code review is explicit and local. Brigade does not auto-run reviewers from `work run`, apply fixes, post review comments, mutate GitHub, store auth, or promote findings automatically.

Chat surface export commands:

- `brigade chat surfaces init` writes gitignored `.brigade/chat-surfaces.toml` with local export surface examples.
- `brigade chat surfaces list`, `show <surface-id>`, and `doctor` inspect local export paths, providers, privacy mode, evidence policy, confidence thresholds, and stale sweep output health.
- `brigade chat sweep validate <path>` checks a local export finding file without writing.
- `brigade chat sweep ingest <surface-id>` normalizes a configured export into `.brigade/chat-memory-sweeps/<surface-id>-latest.json`.
- `brigade chat sweep import-issues <surface-id>` imports normalized actionable findings into the existing work inbox with source `chat-memory-sweep`.

Chat surface exports are local and explicit. Brigade supports `discord-export`, `slack-export`, `telegram-export`, `clickclack-export`, and `generic-jsonl` fixtures, but it does not call live chat APIs, perform OAuth, send webhooks, run a daemon, or promote imports automatically. Raw message bodies and transcript fields are rejected by default; imports keep safe summaries, labels, message ranges, local evidence paths, confidence, and fingerprints.

Portable tool catalog commands:

- `brigade tools init` writes gitignored `.brigade/tools.toml` with local examples for portable slash commands and superpowers.
- `brigade tools list`, `show <tool-id>`, and `search <query>` inspect logical tool entries across source families such as `skill`, `slash-command`, `superpower`, `mcp`, `openapi`, `graphql`, `script`, and `custom`.
- `brigade tools describe <tool-id>` and `brigade tools contracts` inspect schema-backed call contracts, permissions, effects, approval mode, env labels, and argument templates.
- `brigade tools call plan <tool-id> --args ...` validates local JSON args against the configured input schema and returns a redacted wrapper-friendly call plan without executing the tool.
- `brigade tools call queue/list/show/approve/reject/hold` stores planned calls in `.brigade/tools/calls.jsonl` for local review. Approval changes status only and never executes a tool.
- `brigade tools call run <call-id>` and `brigade tools call run --next` execute approved, unblocked local `script` calls and approved local `mcp` calls, then write local receipts and stdout/stderr logs under `.brigade/tools/runs/`.
- `brigade tools run list/show/latest` inspects local execution receipts, and `brigade tools run replay <run-id>` creates a new pending reviewed replay candidate after revalidating current contract, source, runtime, and policy state. Replay never reruns directly.
- `brigade tools checkpoint list/show/approve/reject/resume` reviews script-requested local checkpoints under `.brigade/tools/checkpoints/`; resume requires explicit checkpoint approval and revalidates runtime and policy gates.
- `brigade tools runtime init/list/show/status/start/stop/restart/doctor` manages explicit local runtimes used by portable tool calls, writing PID files and logs under `.brigade/tools/runtime/`.
- `brigade tools policy init/show/doctor` manages host-local execution policy, including allowed effects, timeout caps, runtime allow-lists, approval modes, and environment label bindings.
- `brigade tools plan` previews exact projection creates, updates, skips, unmanaged conflicts, and local-edit conflicts for all configured harness targets.
- `brigade tools apply <tool-id>` and `brigade tools apply --all` explicitly write managed harness projections. Use `--dry-run` to preview writes and `--force` only to overwrite unmanaged or locally edited projection files.
- `brigade tools doctor` reports missing sources, manifests, schemas, invalid contracts, missing examples, bad argument templates, projections, unmanaged projections, locally edited managed projections, stale projection fingerprints, MCP config issues, stale health files, unsafe auth/env field names, and high-risk command shapes.
- `brigade tools import-issues` turns catalog health issues into local `tool-catalog` work imports with stable fingerprints and dismiss-until-changed behavior.

Tool catalog inspection, call planning, call approval review, run history inspection, and checkpoint review are non-executing, and projection writes are always explicit through `brigade tools apply`. Tool call execution is explicit through `brigade tools call run`, limited to approved local `script` entries and approved local `mcp` entries with already-running managed runtimes, and writes local receipts instead of mutating approvals automatically. MCP execution uses a configured local stdio command, sends `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`, and never starts a runtime automatically. Replay creates a pending call from redacted receipt arguments and never recovers secret values or bypasses approval, runtime, or policy gates. Checkpoint resume is explicit through `brigade tools checkpoint resume` and never runs automatically after approval. Runtime start and stop are explicit through `brigade tools runtime`; `doctor`, `brief`, and `work run` never auto-start runtimes. Execution policy is host-local and gitignored; environment values come only from the current process and are not stored in calls, checkpoints, receipts, logs, imports, or docs. Brigade does not connect to remote MCP servers, fetch OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas, store auth, install schedulers, send approval notifications, or auto-sync harness configs from `doctor`, `brief`, or `work run`. Keep tokens, secrets, private URLs, and host-private paths out of public catalog templates.

Backup health commands:

- `brigade work backup init` writes gitignored `.brigade/backups.toml` with local NAS and cloud destination examples.
- `brigade work backup status` and `doctor` read local JSON summaries for latest snapshot, check, prune, and restore rehearsal status.
- `brigade work backup import-issues` turns stale snapshots, failed checks, stale prunes, missing summaries, overdue restore rehearsals, and unsafe summary fields into local `backup-health` work imports.

Backup health summaries are local and read-only. Brigade does not run `restic`, mount storage, prune, restore, send webhooks, or mutate remote backup state. Keep real hostnames, remotes, mount paths, repo paths, webhook URLs, channel ids, and backup passwords out of public templates and summary records.

Run the daily loop with `brigade work run`.
It opens a work session, resolves the next task, runs `brigade dogfood`, and closes completed ledger tasks after successful runs.
When the resolved ledger task has acceptance criteria, `work run` includes them in the task prompt as the definition of done.
When `work run` consumes a queued task, the session artifacts record the task snapshot, issue metadata, and acceptance checklist in `session.json`, `start.md`, and `end.md`.
Successful runs also store the completed session path, dogfood run path, and completion-time acceptance criteria on the task.
Then it ends the session, writes a work-session Memory Handoff by default, and prints a recap.

Useful `work run` switches:

- `--queue-next` queues the successful run's extracted next step for the next session.
- `--title` names the session.
- `--no-handoff` skips the work handoff.
- `--dogfood-handoff` also lets the underlying dogfood run write its own handoff.
- Passing a task overrides the resolved next step.

Manual session commands:

- `brigade work start "title"` opens `.brigade/work/<id>/`, records starting context, and writes `start.md`.
- `brigade work note "checkpoint"` appends a timestamped note to the active session.
- `brigade work end --note "what happened"` closes the active session and writes `end.md`.
- `brigade work end --handoff` also writes a Memory Handoff.

Work verification and closeout commands:

- `brigade work verify plan` previews the local verification commands and current evidence snapshot without running anything.
- `brigade work verify run` executes explicit local verification commands without a shell and writes receipts under `.brigade/work/verify-runs/`.
- `brigade work verify runs` and `brigade work verify show <run-id>` inspect local verification receipts, command exit codes, summaries, and log paths.
- `brigade work closeout <session-id-or-latest>` writes a local closeout receipt under `.brigade/work/closeouts/` that collects task acceptance, latest verification, scanner sweep status, code review closeout state, handoff draft status, and session evidence.

Verification and closeout are local gates. Brigade does not mutate CI, GitHub, reviewers, scanner promotions, handoff ingestion, daemons, or schedulers. Verification commands run only when explicitly requested.

See [`docs/work-closeout.md`](docs/work-closeout.md) for the verification command rules, closeout record contents, and ready-state checklist.

Release readiness commands:

- `brigade release plan` collects local publish-readiness evidence without writing a receipt.
- `brigade release doctor` runs local publish checks such as content-guard when available and reports blockers.
- `brigade release run` writes a release-readiness receipt under `.brigade/release/runs/`.
- `brigade release runs` and `brigade release show <run-id>` inspect local release receipts.
- `brigade release candidate plan` previews a local release candidate bundle.
- `brigade release candidate build` writes a local bundle under `.brigade/release/candidates/`.
- `brigade release candidate list`, `show`, and `archive` inspect or archive local candidate bundles.

Release readiness is a local publish gate. It reviews latest work closeout, verification, code review closeout, scanner sweep state, security health, handoff draft health, content-guard results, git state, and docs/changelog/roadmap touch warnings. It never pushes, tags, creates releases, comments remotely, or mutates remotes.

See [`docs/release-readiness.md`](docs/release-readiness.md) for the receipt contract and local-only boundary.
See [`docs/release-candidates.md`](docs/release-candidates.md) for the candidate bundle files and manual-only publish plan.

### Memory And Bootstrap Health

Memory and bootstrap readiness are part of the same operating-system health story.
`brigade doctor` checks installed bootstrap files against hard byte budgets so overgrown files fail before agents load truncated context.

It also checks:

- `memory/cards/*.md` budgets
- `MEMORY.md` card links under `memory/cards/`
- memory-care config, scan freshness, open refresh candidates, and queue validity
- corrupt scan or refresh-queue JSON once the loop is wired

Workspace installs include `.brigade/memory-care.example.json` as a legacy scanner wiring contract, and `brigade memory care init` writes the active gitignored `.brigade/memory-care.toml` scanner config.
They also include `.brigade/chat-memory-sweep.example.json` for nightly chat/session sweep summaries.
Missing memory-care state is advisory for fresh installs.
Bootstrap truncation is a hard failure to prevent, not a cosmetic warning.

Memory care is local and explicit. Brigade writes scan reports and work imports, but it does not edit memory cards, run a scheduler, mutate canonical memory, or use LLM inference for contradictions.

Inspect local work sessions with:

- `brigade work list`
- `brigade work latest`
- `brigade work show <session-id-or-path>`
- `brigade work recap`
- `brigade work recap --since YYYY-MM-DD`

Inspect a completed run without opening each JSON file:

```bash
brigade runs list --cwd /path/to/repo
brigade runs latest --cwd /path/to/repo
brigade runs show .brigade/runs/<run-id>
brigade security init
brigade security fix
brigade security scan --target .
brigade security scan --target . --policy public-repo
brigade security scan --target . --output-dir .brigade/security/latest
brigade security config
brigade security doctor
brigade security findings
brigade security show <finding-id>
brigade security enrich --target .
brigade security suppress <finding-id-or-fingerprint> --reason "reviewed false positive"
brigade security unsuppress <finding-id-or-fingerprint>
brigade security scan --target . --import-findings
```

Use `--handoff` to bridge a completed run back into the memory system.

Handoff behavior:

- By default it writes a reviewable handoff to `.claude/memory-handoffs/` under `--cwd`.
- Use `--handoff-inbox <path>` for Codex, OpenCode, GPT, Hermes, OpenClaw, or another writer inbox.
- The handoff targets `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` as a `no-card` document update.
- `brigade handoff lint` validates pending handoffs before ingest. Card actions require `Target card` plus `Suggested card content` and must omit document sections; `no-card` actions require document sections and must omit card sections.
- The normal `brigade ingest` route can review or ingest that handoff.
- If handoff writing fails after synthesis, Brigade still prints the final answer and keeps the final artifacts.
- Failed handoff writes exit nonzero and mark `run.json` as `handoff-failed`.
- `--handoff` is not allowed with `--dry-run` because dry runs have no final answer.

Live smoke test, using a temporary Codex-only roster:

```bash
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
smoke_cwd=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
mkdir -p "$tmpdir/.brigade"
cat > "$tmpdir/.brigade/roster.toml" <<'EOF'
orchestrator = "chef"

[agents.chef]
cli = "codex"
role = "Plan one small read-only task and synthesize a one-sentence final answer."

[agents.coder]
cli = "codex"
role = "Return exactly this sentence, with no shell commands and no extra prose: Brigade full dispatch integration worker succeeded."

[limits]
max_workers = 1
allow_models = ["codex"]
EOF

brigade roster doctor --target "$tmpdir"
timeout 360 brigade run \
  "Integration test: assign the coder worker to return its required success sentence, then synthesize one sentence saying the full Brigade dispatch path succeeded." \
  --roster "$tmpdir/.brigade/roster.toml" \
  --cwd "$smoke_cwd" \
  --output-dir "$tmpdir/run" \
  --handoff \
  --handoff-inbox "$tmpdir/handoffs" \
  --show-plan \
  --read-only
```

Codex may require `--cwd` to be a trusted git repo.
The smoke keeps the roster, artifacts, and handoff inbox in the temp directory while running the agent CLIs from `smoke_cwd`.
Live runs invoke authenticated model CLIs and may consume whatever quota or subscription those CLIs use.
`--dry-run` still invokes the orchestrator, but it does not dispatch workers or synthesize.

## Two axes: depth + harnesses

brigade installs material on two independent axes:

**Depth, how much shared baseline you want:**

| Depth | Installs |
|---|---|
| `repo` *(default)* | `AGENTS.md`, `SAFETY_RULES.md`, `INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md`, `hooks/pre-push`, `.brigade/policies/public-repo.json` |
| `workspace` | repo + `MEMORY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `memory/cards/`, starter cards |

**Harnesses, which tools you actually use:**

| Harness | Role | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | writer | `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/memory-handoffs/` inbox |
| `codex` | writer | `.codex/memory-handoffs/` inbox (AGENTS.md is in the baseline) |
| `openclaw` | reader | `.brigade/openclaw/` config fragments + cron stubs |
| `hermes` | reader | `.brigade/hermes/` adapter fragments (experimental) |

**Includes, optional add-ons:**

| Include | Adds |
|---|---|
| `publisher` | `.brigade/policies/public-content.json` + content-safety memory card + scrub-cache |

## Picking your harnesses

Four common combos:

- **Claude Code only:** `--harnesses claude`, the lightest setup, just one writer.
- **Claude Code + OpenClaw:** `--harnesses claude,openclaw`, durable memory owner (OpenClaw) plus side writer (Claude Code).
- **Claude Code + Codex + OpenClaw:** `--harnesses claude,codex,openclaw`, both writers feed into OpenClaw as the canonical owner.
- **Codex + OpenClaw:** `--harnesses codex,openclaw`, Codex-first user with OpenClaw as the canonical store.

The canonical memory owner is picked automatically by priority (`openclaw > hermes > claude > codex > this-repo`). Override with `--owner`.

Re-running `brigade init` against an existing target is safe.
It refuses to overwrite tracked files without `--force`.
The managed `.gitignore` block is replaced between its markers without touching the rest of your file.

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for setup, verification, and the ingest flow.

## Managed stations

Some stations can install and wire external tools for you.
Run `brigade add <station>` to install any tool attached to that station that is not already on your PATH, then wire its default config.
Tools are never imported in process; Brigade shells out to each CLI, so the boundary stays model-neutral and mixed-language.

```bash
brigade add memory   # memory-doctor + bootstrap-doctor
brigade add guard    # content-guard
brigade add tokens   # tokenjuice
```

`security` is a built-in station with no external managed tool yet.

Security commands:

- `brigade security init` writes gitignored local defaults to `.brigade/security.toml`.
- `brigade security config` shows the local profile, enabled checks, include/exclude paths, severity threshold, output path, suppressions, and enrichment settings.
- `brigade security fix` creates `.brigade/security/` and refreshes the managed `.gitignore` block.
- `brigade security scan --target .` runs a read-only agent workspace security scan.
- `brigade security scan --output-dir .brigade/security/latest` writes redacted report artifacts with stable finding ids, fingerprints, rule ids, severity, category, path, line, safe excerpt, and remediation hint.
- `brigade security scan --import-findings` writes the local evidence bundle and turns unsuppressed findings into deduped `security-scan` work imports with safe metadata.
- `brigade security findings` lists the latest reviewable findings, and `brigade security show <finding-id>` inspects one finding.
- `brigade security doctor` reports config, evidence, suppression, and open-finding health in text or JSON.
- `brigade security enrich --target .` enriches an existing report and writes enrichment artifacts.
- `brigade security review` inspects the latest evidence bundle, including enrichment when present.
- `brigade security suppress <finding-id-or-fingerprint> --reason "..."` suppresses reviewed noise.
- `brigade security unsuppress <finding-id-or-fingerprint>` removes stale suppressions.

The local `.brigade/security.toml` contract supports `scan_profile` values `public-repo`, `internal-workspace`, and `local-only-audit`, plus `enabled_checks`, `include_paths`, `exclude_paths`, `severity_threshold`, suppressions, and `output_path`. Scan state and raw evidence stay under `.brigade/security/` and should remain gitignored. Public reports and work imports use redacted excerpts and safe detail fields, not raw secrets or private infrastructure values. The scanner never calls external SaaS scanners, runs network scans, stores secrets, starts a daemon, or remediates automatically.

The scanner covers:

- secrets and private keys
- broad permissions and risky hooks
- package scripts, GitHub Actions, and Python dependency config
- prompt-injection style instructions
- MCP configs, including remote transports, auto-approval, unpinned `npx`, and shell metacharacters
- MCP sensitive surfaces, including env values, broad file args, high-risk local commands, large server sets, and missing timeouts

Enrichment is explicit and post-scan.
The default `local` provider only summarizes extracted indicators offline.
The `misp` provider is opt-in through gitignored config and an API key environment variable.

`brigade doctor` and `brigade work doctor` report:

- security config health
- enrichment config health
- stale suppressions and missing suppression reasons
- latest evidence bundle status
- whether local security artifacts are ignored

Secret evidence is redacted before reports, artifacts, or imports are written.
Security config supports policy presets (`personal`, `public-repo`, `strict`), `fail_on`, template scanning, fingerprint suppressions, and `[enrichment]` provider settings.

The current managed tools:

| Station | Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `memory` | `memory-doctor` | memory index health, dead-link lint, handoff counts |
| `memory` | `bootstrap-doctor` | bootstrap-file size and limit audit |
| `guard` | `content-guard` | policy-driven content scanning |
| `tokens` | `tokenjuice` | output compaction via host hooks |

`brigade doctor` folds installed tools into its report and surfaces each tool's own health.
A missing optional tool is not a failure.
It shows up as a non-failing `[todo]` hint telling you to run `brigade add <station>`.

### What a green doctor looks like

```text
brigade doctor: target /home/you/agent-kitchen (generic)
  [ok]   bootstrap: AGENTS.md              /home/you/agent-kitchen/AGENTS.md
  [ok]   bootstrap: CLAUDE.md              /home/you/agent-kitchen/CLAUDE.md
  [ok]   bootstrap: MEMORY.md              /home/you/agent-kitchen/MEMORY.md
  [ok]   bootstrap: TOOLS.md               /home/you/agent-kitchen/TOOLS.md
  [ok]   bootstrap: USER.md                /home/you/agent-kitchen/USER.md
  [ok]   bootstrap: SAFETY_RULES.md        /home/you/agent-kitchen/SAFETY_RULES.md
  [ok]   bootstrap: INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md  /home/you/agent-kitchen/INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md
  [ok]   handoff: inbox                    /home/you/agent-kitchen/.claude/memory-handoffs
  [ok]   handoff: TEMPLATE.md              /home/you/agent-kitchen/.claude/memory-handoffs/TEMPLATE.md
  [ok]   handoff: processed/               /home/you/agent-kitchen/.claude/memory-handoffs/processed
  [ok]   memory: cards/                    /home/you/agent-kitchen/memory/cards
  [ok]   publish: hooks/pre-push           /home/you/agent-kitchen/hooks/pre-push
  [ok]   publish: content-guard            /home/you/repos/content-guard

summary: 14 checks, 0 failed, 0 manual
```

Anything `[warn]` is fine; `[fail]` means the install is incomplete. The `openclaw` and `hermes` harnesses add their own checks on top.

### Privacy

brigade makes no network calls by default.
It does not phone home, collect telemetry, or sync anything to a server.
Everything happens on your local filesystem against the templates packaged with the install.

The normal exception is your own configured tooling:

- the `pre-push` hook runs the local `content-guard` scanner before commits leave the machine
- `brigade security enrich` can call MISP only when you explicitly configure and run the `misp` provider

## The design

One memory owner stays canonical.
That is typically OpenClaw or Hermes when present, otherwise `this-repo`.
Writer harnesses drop handoffs into their own inboxes, and the ingester scans all of them.

```text
Claude Code              Codex
     |                     |
     v                     v
.claude/memory-handoffs/ .codex/memory-handoffs/
     \                   /
      \                 /
       v               v
      brigade ingest
              |
              v
  memory/cards/*.md, TOOLS.md, USER.md,
  rules/*.md, .learnings/*.md
```

The ingester is intentionally conservative.
Safe card handoffs become cards.
Targeted updates append to the right file.
Ambiguous material gets kicked out for review instead of being trusted automatically.

For users running multiple agent homes, treat the owner workspace as the hub.
Remote or secondary workspaces can write handoffs into their own per-harness inboxes.
A trusted sync can pull those files into a staging inbox on the owner.
That keeps agents informed without creating multiple canonical memories.

Token-heavy terminal work gets the same treatment.
Make the wrapper explicit, make the escape hatch obvious, and tell every harness what is happening.
The TokenJuice starter card documents Claude Code's PreToolUse wrapper path, Codex's hook setup, and the savings model.

## Maintenance and utility commands

A few commands sit outside the daily loop:

- `brigade reconfigure --target <path>` adjusts an existing install to a new Selection. Pass `--depth`, `--harnesses`, `--owner`, or repeatable `--include`, and add `--prune` to remove files for harnesses you no longer select.
- `brigade scrub --target <path>` runs the local content-guard scanner against a target, defaulting to the `public-repo` policy. Use `--policy <name-or-path>` to pick another policy and `--dry-run` to preview.
- `brigade handoff-template` prints the handoff `TEMPLATE.md`; `--target` prefers a target's installed template when present.
- `brigade openclaw-fragments --out <dir>` writes OpenClaw config fragments for manual review.
- `brigade hermes-fragments --out <dir>` writes Hermes adapter fragments (experimental).
