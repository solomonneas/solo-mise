## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Canonical flat bootstrap thresholds in `brigade.budgets` (`DEFAULT_BOOTSTRAP_SOFT_LIMIT`, `DEFAULT_BOOTSTRAP_HARD_LIMIT`, `BOOTSTRAP_HARD_LIMIT_CEILING`) for the whole-file auditor model, so downstream bootstrap tooling can source one set of limits instead of redeclaring its own.
- Handoff backlog detection. `brigade handoff doctor` (and the memory station in `brigade doctor`) now emits a `handoff_backlog` warning when an inbox has pending handoffs whose oldest entry is older than three days, i.e. handoffs are being written but nothing is ingesting them. `InboxHealth` gained an `oldest_pending_age_seconds` field. At the fleet level, `brigade repos scan`/`doctor` now emit a `repo_handoff_backlog` warning for any fleet repo with an un-ingested, stale handoff pile-up. This catches the silent gap where a repo's inbox is never reached by the canonical ingester (for example an uncovered repo missing from the ingest config).
- Canonical budgets module `brigade.budgets` is now the single source of truth for bootstrap-file byte budgets, memory-card budgets, the MEMORY.md index line limit, and the handoff-backlog and memory-care staleness thresholds. `doctor`, `ingest`, `handoff`, and `repos` all consume it so preventive guards and post-hoc warnings can never disagree. Satellite tools (bootstrap-doctor, memory-doctor) are intended to depend on brigade and consume these definitions rather than redeclaring them.
- Bootstrap budget guard in `brigade ingest`. A `no-card` handoff that would push a bootstrap file (e.g. `TOOLS.md`, `USER.md`) past its byte budget is now routed to the review inbox instead of appended, so the ingester can no longer silently bloat a session-prefix file past its truncation ceiling. Non-bootstrap targets such as `.learnings/*` are unaffected.
- `brigade repos ingest` fleet driver. Sweeps every registered, reachable fleet repo, routing each repo's handoffs into the canonical owner's memory and archiving the processed handoffs back in the source repo. Defaults to a dry run; pass `--apply` to write. `ingest.run` gained an `owner` parameter and a reusable `ingest.ingest_into` core to support the many-writers/one-owner model.

### Changed
- `brigade work backup init` now writes wider staleness thresholds for the `cloud` destination (`snapshot_stale_hours = 192`, `check_stale_hours`/`prune_stale_hours = 336`) so an off-site copy on a slower cadence such as a weekly backup does not report stale every day. The `nas` destination defaults are unchanged. Existing `.brigade/backups.toml` files are not modified.

### Documentation
- `docs/backup-health.md` now documents the two-tier NAS-frequent plus cloud-weekly threshold pattern and clarifies that backup health monitors snapshot-history backups (restic/borg), not bidirectional last-writer-wins file syncs such as a KeePass database mirror.

- `brigade tools init/list/show/search/describe/contracts/call plan/call queue/call list/call show/call approve/call reject/call hold/call run/runtime/policy/plan/apply/doctor/import-issues`, plus `brigade tools run list/show/latest/replay` and `brigade tools checkpoint list/show/approve/reject/resume`, for portable tool, slash command, skill, superpower, script, and MCP catalog discovery plus explicit projection writes, read-only call planning, local call approval review, explicit approved script and local MCP execution, run history inspection, replay review, checkpointed resume, runtime supervision, and host-local execution policy.
- Tool catalog health checks for missing sources, missing manifests or schemas, invalid schema JSON, invalid contract schemas, missing examples, bad argument templates, missing contracts, parity gaps, missing projections, unmanaged projections, locally edited managed projections, stale projections, MCP config issues, stale health files, unsafe auth/env fields, and high-risk command shapes.
- Schema-backed call plans validate local JSON args against a dependency-free JSON Schema subset, render configured argument templates, report blockers, and redact secret-looking fields without invoking tools.
- Portable tool call approvals are stored in gitignored `.brigade/tools/calls.jsonl`, dedupe equivalent pending or approved calls, reject blocked approvals, and surface stale pending or stale approved calls in doctor, brief, and `tool-catalog` imports.
- Approved portable script calls can now be run explicitly with `brigade tools call run <call-id>` or `--next`, with local receipts and stdout/stderr logs written under gitignored `.brigade/tools/runs/`.
- `brigade tools run list/show/latest/replay` inspects local execution receipts and queues reviewed replay candidates without direct reruns or bypassing approval, runtime, or policy gates.
- `brigade tools checkpoint list/show/approve/reject/resume` records script-requested local checkpoints, reviews allowed resume choices, and resumes only after revalidating approval, runtime, policy, contract, source, and projection gates.
- Approved local MCP calls can now run through `brigade tools call run` via a configured local stdio command, already-running managed runtime, JSON-RPC `initialize` / `tools/list` / `tools/call`, and receipts with redacted MCP request and response summaries.
- `brigade tools runtime init/list/show/status/start/stop/restart/doctor` for explicit local runtime supervision with PID files, logs, stale PID detection, port conflict checks, health checks, and tool-call runtime gating.
- `brigade tools policy init/show/doctor` for host-local execution policy, including allowed families/effects, denied effects, required approval modes, timeout caps, runtime allow-lists, and env label bindings without storing secrets.
- Managed tool projections record source and projection fingerprints so `brigade tools plan`, `apply`, and `doctor` can distinguish missing, current, stale, unmanaged, and conflicted projection states.
- `tool-catalog` inbox imports with stable source fingerprints and dismissed-import protection until a catalog issue materially changes.
- `brigade work import triage` to group pending imports by source and kind.
- `brigade work import dismiss` to close noisy imports without promoting them.
- `brigade work import promote --all` with optional `--source` and `--kind` filters for batch promotion.
- `brigade work import list/triage/promote/dismiss` metadata filters for scanner-specific fields such as `handoff_issue_category`.

- `brigade handoff doctor` to compare pending `.claude` and `.codex` memory handoffs against gitignored local source config.
- Repo installs now include `.brigade/handoff-sources.example.json` as the local handoff ingestor source-list contract.
- `brigade handoff doctor` ingestor-log checks for stale latest-run logs, skipped malformed handoffs, warning summaries, and no-reply/no-update masking signals.
- `brigade handoff issues` and `brigade handoff import-issues` to turn handoff ingest warnings into grouped repair guidance and local work imports.
- `brigade handoff issues --category` and `brigade handoff import-issues --category` for category-limited handoff issue review/import.
- `brigade handoff lint` to validate pending or explicit handoff files before ingest and catch card/document action mismatches that would be skipped later.
- `brigade handoff sync-issues` to import new handoff-ingest issues without resurrecting dismissed ones and close stale local handoff tasks/imports.
- `docs/import-schema.md` documenting the local import JSONL contract for scanners and wrappers.
- Cybersecurity plugin roadmap covering broad agent-workspace security checks plus Brigade-specific scanner, doctor, import, and multi-harness security checks.
- Built-in `security` station and `brigade security scan` for read-only agent workspace security checks.
- Deeper MCP security checks for unpinned `npx`, shell metacharacters, secret-looking env values, sensitive or broad file args, high-risk local commands, large server sets, and missing timeouts.
- Supply-chain security checks for package scripts, GitHub Actions permissions and action refs, Python URL dependencies, and legacy install hooks.
- `brigade security enrich` for explicit post-scan enrichment artifacts, with an offline local provider and opt-in MISP provider config.
- `brigade security scan --import-findings` to route security findings into the local work import inbox for review, with source `security-scan`, stable source fingerprints, safe metadata, evidence paths, and dismissed-import protection.
- `brigade security init` to write gitignored local defaults to `.brigade/security.toml`, including scan profiles, enabled checks, include/exclude paths, severity thresholds, suppressions, and output paths.
- `brigade security config`, `brigade security doctor`, `brigade security findings`, and `brigade security show <finding-id>` for local config inspection, health checks, grouped finding review, and single-finding inspection.
- `brigade security fix` to create the local security artifact directory and refresh the managed `.gitignore` block.
- `brigade security review`, `brigade security suppress`, and `brigade security unsuppress` for a local finding review lifecycle with required suppression reasons. Suppress and unsuppress accept finding ids, id prefixes, or fingerprints.
- Security policy presets (`personal`, `public-repo`, `strict`), scan profiles (`public-repo`, `internal-workspace`, `local-only-audit`), template scanning controls, stable finding ids and fingerprints, and fingerprint suppressions.
- `brigade security scan --output-dir <dir>` to write redacted `security-report.json` and `security-report.md` evidence bundles.
- `brigade work brief`, `brigade doctor`, and `brigade work doctor` now report security config health, latest security evidence bundle status, open finding health, and local security artifact ignore coverage.
- `brigade doctor` and `brigade work doctor` now warn on stale security suppressions and suppressions missing reasons.
- Security scan secret evidence is redacted before reports, docs, session artifacts, or work imports are written.
- `ROADMAP.md` covering the daily-driver path, scanner-ready inbox, chat-surface scanners, memory-card decay refresh, and portable operator setup.
- `brigade work note` to append timestamped checkpoints to the active work session without ending it.
- `brigade work doctor` to check dogfood config, Codex availability, local artifact paths, handoff inbox, ignore coverage, and latest run context for the daily work loop.
- Workspace installs now include `.brigade/memory-care.example.json` as a scanner wiring contract for memory-care decay output.
- Workspace installs now include `.brigade/chat-memory-sweep.example.json` plus an OpenClaw memory-sweep cron fragment for nightly chat/session sweep wiring.
- Roster-level and per-agent `timeout_seconds` controls for bounded CLI calls.
- `brigade run --read-only` prompt policy for planning and review runs that should inspect and recommend only, with native `codex exec --sandbox read-only` enforcement for Codex agents.

### Changed
- `brigade roadmap audit` now reads documented commands from command snippets instead of prose and normalizes parameterized examples such as `brigade tools show <id>` to their CLI command path.
- `brigade roadmap audit --json` now includes deferred roadmap ownership records with subsystem, owner, reason, source section, status, and suggested phase.
- Roadmap phase headings now distinguish foundations, active work, and the phase queue so stale Current/Next warnings are actionable.
- Public repo contents now keep live dogfood workspace files, internal planning notes, and root memory cards untracked; public templates remain under `src/brigade/templates/`.
- Dogfood handoff defaults now use `.codex/memory-handoffs/` for new Codex-driven local configs while preserving explicit configured inbox paths such as `.claude/memory-handoffs/`.
- Bootstrap truncation is now treated as a hard doctor failure to prevent by moving durable detail into memory cards before agents load context.
- Dogfood runs now default to a 600 second per-agent timeout for practical daily repo reviews.
- Dogfood next-step extraction now handles markdown `## Next` sections and can fall back to `summary.md` when `final.txt` does not contain a next-step label.
- `brigade work run` now consumes the oldest pending ledger task before falling back to the latest extracted dogfood next step, and marks consumed tasks done after successful runs.
- `brigade work task add --from-next` now reuses an equivalent pending task instead of adding duplicates.
- `brigade work brief` now reports acceptance coverage for the next ledger task, and `brigade work run` passes accepted ledger criteria into the dogfood task prompt.
- `brigade work brief` now includes pending local work imports and import counts in both text and JSON output.
- `brigade work brief` now surfaces issue-backed next-task context.
- `brigade work doctor` now warns on pending tasks without acceptance criteria, unchecked or closed issue-backed tasks, and active work sessions left open too long.
- `brigade work doctor` now warns on stale scanner imports, task imports missing acceptance criteria, and noisy scanner sources with many dismissed imports.
- `brigade work brief` now surfaces pending handoff ingest issue counts when the local handoff source config has an ingestor latest-run log.
- The managed gitignore block now treats `.brigade/dogfood.toml`, `.brigade/security.toml`, `.brigade/runs/`, and `.brigade/security/` as local state.
- The managed gitignore block now treats `.brigade/handoff-sources.json` as host-local state.
- Live smoke docs now keep Codex agent execution in a trusted repo cwd while writing temporary roster, artifacts, and handoff output under `/tmp`.
- Handoff write failures now preserve final run artifacts, print the final answer, return nonzero, and mark `run.json` as `handoff-failed`.
- Dogfood runs default to prompt-level read-only plus Codex's `danger-full-access` sandbox setting for trusted-workspace use so repo inspection works on hosts where native read-only sandboxing blocks shell inspection; `--native-read-only-sandbox` opts into stricter native enforcement.

### Fixed
- `brigade init` now collapses mixed current and legacy managed `.gitignore` blocks into one regenerated Brigade block.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Managed tools: external CLIs that Brigade can install and wire per station via `brigade add <station>`. Brigade shells out to each tool, never importing it in process.
- `memory-doctor` and `bootstrap-doctor` attached to the `memory` station.
- `content-guard` attached to the `guard` station.
- New `tokens` station with `tokenjuice` for output compaction.
- `brigade doctor` folds installed managed tools into its report and surfaces each tool's own health. Tools that are not installed are reported as non-failing `[todo]` hints, so doctor stays green on a bare host.
- `memory-doctor` and `bootstrap-doctor` inspect the operator's canonical memory and bootstrap files (host-global), so their findings are labeled operator-scoped and treated as advisory `[warn]`, never failing a workspace `brigade doctor` run.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-24

### Changed
- Renamed the project to **Brigade**. The PyPI distribution is now `brigade-cli` and the command is `brigade`. The workspace config directory is now `.brigade`, with a `.solo-mise` read fallback so older installs keep working.

### Added
- Built-in station registry that drives the doctor checks.
- `brigade status` command, alongside `brigade init` and `brigade doctor`, reporting over the station registry.

### Deprecated
- The `solo-mise` command is kept as a deprecated alias for `brigade`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-17

### Breaking
- Removed the `--profile <name>` flag from `solo-mise init`. The flag has been deprecated since v0.3.0 with a stderr migration warning. Use `--depth <minimal|standard|deep>` plus `--harnesses <list>` instead. Migration table in the v0.3.0 notes below.

### Internal cleanup
Removed `src/solo_mise/init.py`, the `templates/profiles/` directory and its six legacy profile manifests, plus `templates.load_profile` and `selection.profile_to_selection`. No user-facing impact beyond the flag removal above.

### Migration

Same as v0.3.0. If you somehow have v0.2.0-era scripts still using `--profile`, see the table in the v0.3.0 section below.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Two-axis selection model: `--depth {repo,workspace}` + `--harnesses {claude,codex,openclaw,hermes}` + `--include publisher`. Pick any combination of harnesses.
- Interactive prompt on bare `solo-mise init` (no flags). Defaults to claude + repo + no includes.
- `.solo-mise/config.json` is now the per-target source of truth for selection state. Read by `doctor`, `ingest`, and `reconfigure`.
- `solo-mise reconfigure --target . [--prune]` adjusts an existing install to a new selection. `--prune` removes orphaned files for deselected harnesses.
- Per-writer handoff inboxes: `.codex/memory-handoffs/` for Codex (in addition to existing `.claude/memory-handoffs/`).
- Ingester now scans all configured writer inboxes.
- Doctor reports apparent harness shape, checks per-writer inbox, warns on orphaned inbox dirs from unselected harnesses.

### Changed
- README reframed around the two-axis model. New "Picking your harnesses" section walks through four common combos.
- CONTRIBUTING.md "Adding a profile" replaced by "Adding a harness" + "Adding a depth" + "Adding an include".

### Deprecated
- `solo-mise init --profile <x>` still works but prints a stderr deprecation note pointing at the new flags. Will be removed in v0.4.0.

### Migration

If you have v0.2.0 scripts using `--profile`:

| v0.2.0 | v0.3.0+ |
|---|---|
| `--profile repo` | `--depth repo --harnesses claude` |
| `--profile workspace` | `--depth workspace --harnesses claude` |
| `--profile openclaw` | `--depth workspace --harnesses claude,openclaw` |
| `--profile hermes` | `--depth workspace --harnesses claude,hermes` |
| `--profile generic` | `--depth workspace --harnesses none` |
| `--profile publisher` | `--depth repo --harnesses claude --include publisher` |

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Memory-care staleness scaffolding: `memory/cards/decay/` layout and a doctor
  warning when the decay folder is missing, so durable cards do not quietly rot.
- Multi-workspace handoff patterns for users administering more than one agent
  home; secondary workspaces write into their own `.claude/memory-handoffs/`,
  the owner pulls those into a staging inbox.
- TokenJuice output-compaction guidance card covering Claude Code's PreToolUse
  wrapper path, Codex hook setup, and realistic savings expectations.
- Obsidian `/note` skill template under `skills/note/` for the `workspace`
  profile.
- `scripts/backup-restic.sh` template, exposed via the `workspace` profile.
- Managed `.gitignore` block: `solo-mise init` now creates or updates a
  `# >>> solo-mise gitignore block >>>` section in the target's `.gitignore`.
  Re-runs replace only the content between the markers, so user-authored rules
  are preserved. Skip with `--no-gitignore`.
- Release pipeline: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` builds an sdist + wheel on
  every `v*` tag and pushes to PyPI.
- CI matrix: `install-from-source` smoke now runs against all six profiles
  (`repo`, `workspace`, `openclaw`, `hermes`, `generic`, `publisher`).
- Project meta: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug, profile-init-fails, ingester-misclassified).

### Changed
- Deepened the `workspace` profile's bootstrap files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `SAFETY_RULES.md`,
  `TOOLS.md`, `USER.md`, `INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md`).
- README: centered banner, refreshed badges, added a sample `doctor` run,
  noted that solo-mise makes no network calls, called out `init` idempotency.
- CI now pins the `content-guard` checkout to `v0.1.1` instead of tracking the
  default branch.
- `solo-mise init --profile hermes` prints a louder experimental-status notice
  on stderr in addition to the post-install note.

### Removed
- Stale `DREAMS.md` from the repo root and lingering references in templates.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-13

Initial release.

### Added
- `solo-mise` CLI with `init`, `doctor`, `scrub`, and `handoff-template`
  subcommands.
- Six profiles: `repo` (default), `workspace`, `openclaw`, `hermes`,
  `generic`, `publisher`.
- Conservative handoff ingester at `.claude/memory-handoffs/`: safe card
  handoffs become cards, targeted updates append, ambiguous material is
  kicked out for review.
- Content-guard pre-push hook for public-leak prevention.
- Sanitized bootstrap file set, starter memory cards, routing rules.
- OpenClaw adapter fragments and harness-aware doctor checks.
- Experimental Hermes adapter fragments.
